COVID-19 crisis had made us re-think the spatial organization of indoor places.

It is hard to define and evaluate the contagion risk, entangling space management and optimization of human resources.

We present you a solution which will use the already existing digital technology to give a real time contagion risk evaluation in public spaces.

We combine variables such as physical distance, person per square meter, temperature and ventilation in order to get the most accurate data, aiding facility managers to keep the space safe and functional.

We also can generate a heatmap, which proved to be helpful to plan and organize decontamination and sterilization procedures.

Our software does not collect or store any personal data, assuring your privacy will always be our main priority.

Keeping you safe is our mission!
